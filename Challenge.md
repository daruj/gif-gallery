# Coding Challenge Requirements

Hi,

This is your home assignment. You need to develop a “gallery” which will allow users to search for gifs on giphy and then display them. Here are some prerequisites and requirements:

1. **Giphy API Token**: Register a free app with Giphy and obtain an API token.

2. **Display Results**: Show the first 24 results, and when scrolling, append another 20 (implement infinite scroll).

3. **Search as You Type**: Implement a “search as you type” functionality, eliminating the need for a “search button.”

4. **Debounce Implementation**: Incorporate a debounce mechanism to ensure that the search begins only after the user finishes typing the word.

5. **Testing**: Your code should include comprehensive tests.

6. **TypeScript and Typings**: Implement your code using TypeScript and provide appropriate typings.

7. **Production Quality**: Code should be in “production quality” to ensure reliability and maintainability.

8. **React and TypeScript**: The client-side should be developed in React, and the code should be in TypeScript.

9. **Libraries Usage**: You can use any libraries you wish, but ensure the client side is in React, and the code is in TypeScript.

10. **Research Resources**: You are allowed to use Google/Stack Overflow for reference.

11. **Code Review**: After submitting your code, be prepared to go over it with the reviewer and explain your implementation if necessary.

12. **GitHub Repository**: Store your code on GitHub and share the repository link.

Good luck!
